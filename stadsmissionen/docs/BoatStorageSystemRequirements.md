- **Simple add/remove**: intuitive UI for zone management

#### **2. Multi-Level Storage:**
- **Floor/shelf system** for smaller boats
- **Vertical stacking capability**
- **Level-specific boat placement**

### **Marina-Specific Features:**
- **End-point marking system**:
  - **Land connection**: dock connects to shore
  - **Dock-to-dock**: connects to another marina section
  - **Water terminus**: open water end
- **Linear boat placement** along dock edges

### **Design Philosophy:**
- **Elegant, intuitive interface**
- **Professional CAD-like functionality**
- **Real-world scale accuracy**
- **Visual clarity for complex layouts**

â””â”€â”€ ðŸ†• BÃ¥tlager (Boat Storage Management)
    â”œâ”€â”€ Lager (Warehouse View)
    â””â”€â”€ Bryggor (Marina View)
```

### **Core Functionality:**

#### **Boat Placement Engine:**
- **Dimensional matching**: boat length/width + safety margins
- **Rotation capability**: boats can rotate to optimize fit
- **Intelligent suggestions**: system recommends best placement
- **Visual collision detection**: prevents overlapping placements

#### **Boat Status Tracking:**
- **Physically Present**: boat is currently in the assigned location
- **Reserved/Absent**: space is booked but boat is elsewhere
  - With customer
  - On seasonal marina
  - In service/maintenance
- **Visual indicators**: clear status representation

#### **Transfer Management:**
- **Drag-and-drop** boat movement between locations
- **Cross-facility transfers**: warehouse â†” marina
- **Seasonal migration**: automatic winter/summer movements
- **Transfer history**: audit trail of boat movements

#### **Search & Location System:**
- **Boat-centric search**: find any boat instantly
- **Customer integration**: link to customer registry
- **Map integration**: show location on overview map
- **Multi-criteria filtering**: by status, size, customer, etc.

## ðŸŽ¯ **TECHNICAL INTEGRATION POINTS**

### **Map System Integration:**
- **Overview map synchronization**: storage locations appear on main map
- **Deep linking**: click storage on map â†’ open detailed view
- **Geographic context**: real-world positioning accuracy

### **Customer Database Integration:**
- **Low customer turnover optimization**: stable, long-term relationships
- **Boat ownership tracking**: multiple boats per customer
- **Storage history**: seasonal patterns and preferences
- **Contract management**: storage agreements and billing

### **Seasonal Workflow Support:**
- **Dual allocation management**: boat has both warehouse AND marina space
- **Active location tracking**: which space currently occupied
- **Migration scheduling**: automated seasonal transfers
- **Capacity planning**: optimize space utilization year-round

## ðŸŽ¯ **USER EXPERIENCE GOALS**

### **For Storage Managers:**
- **Visual clarity**: immediate understanding of storage status
- **Efficient placement**: minimize time to assign boat locations
- **Easy transfers**: simple boat relocation process
- **Comprehensive overview**: full facility utilization at a glance

### **For Operations Staff:**
- **Quick boat location**: instant search results
- **Clear instructions**: where to place/retrieve boats
- **Status visibility**: which boats are physically present
- **Movement tracking**: who moved what, when

### **For Management:**
- **Capacity optimization**: maximize revenue per square meter
- **Utilization analytics**: identify underused areas
- **Customer satisfaction**: efficient boat handling
- **Operational efficiency**: reduce manual coordination
